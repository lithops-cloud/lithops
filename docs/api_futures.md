# Lithops Futures API Details

## Executor
The primary object in Lithops is the executor. The standard way to get everything set up is to import `lithops`, and create an instance of one of the available modes of executions.

Lithops is shipped with 3 modes of execution: **Localhost**, **Serverless** and **Standalone**. In this sense, each mode of execution has its own executor class:

* `lithops.LocalhostExecutor()`: Executor that uses local processes to run jobs in the local machine.
* `lithops.ServerlessExecutor()`: Executor to run jobs in one of the available serverless compute backends.
* `lithops.StandaloneExecutor()`: Executor to run jobs in one of the available standalone compute backends.

Additionally, Lithops includes a top-level function executor, which encompasses all three previous executors:

* `lithops.FunctionExecutor()`: Generic executor that will use the configuration to determine its mode of execution, i.e., based on the configuration it will be **localhost**, **serverless** or **standalone**.


By default, the executor load the configuration from the config file. Alternatively, you can pass the configuration with a python dictionary. In any case, note that all the parameters set in the executor will overwrite those set in the configuration.


The available calls within an executor are:

|API Call| Type | Description|
|---|---|---|
|[call_async()](api_futures.md#executorcall_async) | Async. | Method used to spawn one function activation |
|[map()](api_futures.md#executormap) | Async. | Method used to spawn multiple function activations |

## Executor.plot()

Creates 2 detailed execution plots: A timeline plot and a histogram plot.

**plot**(\*\*kwargs)

|Parameter| Default |Description|
|---|---|---|
|fs| None | List of futures to plot. If None, Lithops uses the internally stored futures|
|dst| None  | Path to destination file, either absolute or relative. If set, you must specify the path + the file prefix (see example below), then lithops will generate the *prefix*_histogram.png and *prefix*_timeline.png files. If None, Lithops will create a new folder called *plots* in the current directory and use the current timestamp as file *prefix* |

* **Returns**: *Nothing*. It stores 2 different plots in the selected `dst` path.

* **Usage**:

    ```python
    iterdata = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    fexec.map(foo, iterdata)
    results = fexec.get_result()  # or fexec.wait()
    # The next command will generate test_timeline.png and test_histogram.png in ~/lithops_plots
    fexec.plot(dst='~/lithops_plots/test') 
    ```

* **Example**:

<p align="center">
  <img width="48%" src="source/images/timeline.png"></img>
  <img width="48%" src="source/images/histogram.png"></img>
</p>

## Executor.clean()

Cleans the temporary data generated by Lithops in IBM COS. This process runs asynchronously to the main execution since Lithops starts another process to do the task. If `data_cleaner=True` (default), this method is executed automatically after calling `get_result()`.

**clean**(\*\*kwargs)

|Parameter| Default |Description|
|---|---|---|
|fs| None | List of futures to clean temp data. If None, Lithops uses the internally stored futures |
|cs| None | List of cloudobjects to clean |
|clean_cloudobjects| True | Clean or not the cloudobjects generated in the executor |
|spawn_cleaner| True | Spawn cleaner process. If false it stores the data to be cleaned in a tmp dir |

* **Returns**: *Nothing*.

* **Usage**:

    ```python
    iterdata = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    futures = fexec.map(foo, iterdata)
    results = fexec.get_result()
    fexec.clean()
    ```

* **Code example**: [map.py](../examples/map.py)


# Function chaining

Function chaining is a pattern where multiple functions are called on the same executor consecutively. Using the same `lithops.FunctionExecutor` object reference, multiple functions can be invoked. It increases the readability of the code and means less redundancy. This means we chain multiple functions together with the same element reference. It’s not necessary to attach the `lithops.FunctionExecutor` reference multiple times for each function call.

This patter is specially useful when the output of one invocation is the input of another invocation. In this case, Lithops does not download the intermediate results to the local client, instead, the intermediate results are directly read from the next function.

It currently works with the Futures API, and you can chain the `map()`, `map_reuce()`, `wait()` and `get_result()` methods. Note that the returning value of one function must match the signature of the next function when chaining multiple `map()` calls. View the next examples:


Getting the result from a single `map()` call:

```python
import lithops

def my_func1(x):
    return x*2

iterdata = [1, 2, 3]

fexec = lithops.FunctionExecutor()
res = fexec.map(my_func1, iterdata).get_result()
print(res)
```


Chain multiple map() calls and get the final result:

```python
import lithops


def my_func1(x):
    return x*2, 5
    
def my_func2(x, y):
    return x+y

iterdata = [1, 2, 3]

fexec = lithops.FunctionExecutor()
res = fexec.map(my_func1, iterdata).map(my_func2).get_result()
print(res)
```

There is no limit in the number of map() calls that can be chained:

```python
def my_func1(x):
    return x+2, 5


def my_func2(x, y):
    return x+y, 5, 2


def my_func3(x, y, z):
    return x+y+z


iterdata = [1, 2, 3]

fexec = lithops.FunctionExecutor()
res = fexec.map(my_func1, iterdata).map(my_func2).map(my_func3).get_result()
print(res)
```

Alternatively, you can pass the `futures` generated in a `map()` or `map_reduce()` call to the `iterdata` parameter with the same effect. Not that in this case you will only get the results of the last `map()` execution. Results of intermediate `map()`s are never downloaded:

```python
def my_func1(x):
    return x+2, 5


def my_func2(x, y):
    return x+y, 5, 2


def my_func3(x, y, z):
    return x+y+z


iterdata = [1, 2, 3]

fexec = lithops.FunctionExecutor()
futures1 = fexec.map(my_func1, iterdata)
futures2 = fexec.map(my_func2, futures1)
futures3 = fexec.map(my_func3, futures2)
final_result = fexec.get_result()

print(final_result)
```
