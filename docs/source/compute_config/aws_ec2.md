# AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

The AWS EC2 client of Lithops can provide a truely serverless user experience on top of EC2 where Lithops creates new Virtual Machines (VMs) dynamically in runtime and scale Lithops jobs against them (Create & Reuse modes). Alternatively Lithops can start and stop an existing VM instance (Consume mode).

## AWS 
The assumption that you already familiar with AWS, and you have AUTH credentials to your account (HMAC Credentials).

### Choose an operating system image for the VM
Any Virtual Machine (VM) need to define the instanceâ€™s operating system and version. Lithops support both standard operating system choices provided by the VPC or using pre-defined custom images that already contains all dependencies required by Lithops.

- Option 1: By default, Lithops uses an Ubuntu 22.04 image. In this case, no further action is required and you can continue to the next step. Lithops will install all required dependencies in the VM by itself. Notice this can consume about 3 min to complete all installations.

- Option 2: Alternatively, you can use a pre-built custom image that will greatly improve VM creation time for Lithops jobs. To benefit from this approach, navigate to [runtime/aws_ec2](https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops/tree/master/runtime/aws_ec2), and follow the instructions.

## Installation

1. Install AWS backend dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install lithops[aws]
```

## Create and reuse modes
In the `create` mode, Lithops will automatically create new worker VM instances in runtime, scale Lithops job against generated VMs, and automatically delete the VMs when the job is completed.
Alternatively, you can set the `reuse` mode to keep running the started worker VMs, and reuse them for further executions. In the `reuse` mode, Lithops checks all the available worker VMs and start new workers only if necessary.


### Configuration

1. Navigate to **IAM > Policies**. Click on **Create policy**. If you already created this policy for the AWS Lambda or AWS Batch backend, jump to step 4.

2. Select **JSON** tab and paste the following JSON policy:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "lambda:*",
                "ec2:*",
                "ecr:*",
                "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Click **Next: Tags** and **Next: Review**. Fill the policy name field (you can name it `lithops-policy` or similar) and create the policy.

4. Go back to **IAM** and navigate to **Roles** tab. Click **Create role**.

5. Choose **EC2** on the use case list. Click **Next: Permissions**. Select the policy created before (`lithops-policy`). Click **Next: Tags** and **Next: Review**. Type a role name, for example `ec2LithopsInstanceRole`. Click on **Create Role**.


### AWS Credential setup

Lithops loads AWS credentials as specified in the [boto3 configuration guide](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html).

In summary, you can use one of the following settings:

1. Provide the credentials via the `~/.aws/config` file, or set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

    You can run `aws configure` command if the AWS CLI is installed to setup the credentials. Then set in the Lithops config file:
    ```yaml
    lithops:
        backend: aws_ec2

    aws_ec2:
        region : <REGION_NAME>
        instance_role: <IAM_INSTANCE_ROLE_NAME>
        exec_mode: reuse
    ```

2. Provide the credentials in the `aws` section of the Lithops config file:
    ```yaml
    lithops:
        backend: aws_ec2

    aws:
        access_key_id: <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
        secret_access_key: <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
        region: <REGION_NAME>

    aws_ec2:
        instance_role: <IAM_INSTANCE_ROLE_NAME>
        exec_mode: reuse
    ```

|aws | session_token | |no | Session token for temporary AWS credentials |
|aws | account_id | |no | *This field will be used if present to retrieve the account ID instead of using AWS STS. The account ID is used to format full image names for container runtimes. |

### EC2 - Create and Reuse Modes

|Group|Key|Default|Mandatory|Additional info|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|aws_ec2 | region | |no | Region name, for example: `eu-west-1`. Lithops will use the `region` set under the `aws` section if it is not set here |
|aws_ec2 | instance_role | | yes | EC2 Instance role name created in the configuration section above. Do not use the full ARN here; only the role name is required. For example: `ec2LithopsInstanceRole`|
|aws_ec2 | vpc_id | | no | VPC id. You can find all the available VPCs in the [VPC Console page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/v2/home#vpcs:) |

|aws_ec2 | security_group_id | | no | Security group ID. You can find the available security groups in the [VPC console page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/v2/home#SecurityGroups:). The security group must have ports 22 and 8080 open |
|aws_ec2 | ssh_key_name | | no | SSH Key name. You can find the available keys in the [EC2 console page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#KeyPairs:). Create a new one or upload your own key if it does not exist|

|aws_ec2 | master_instance_type | t2.micro | no | Profile name for the master VM |
|aws_ec2 | worker_instance_type | t2.medium | no | Profile name for the worker VMs |
|aws_ec2 | delete_on_dismantle | True | no | Delete the worker VMs when they are stopped. Master VM is never deleted when stopped |
|aws_ec2 | max_workers | 100 | no | Max number of workers per `FunctionExecutor()`|

|aws_ec2 | exec_mode | reuse | no | One of: **consume**, **create** or **reuse**. If set to  **create**, Lithops will automatically create new VMs for each map() call based on the number of elements in iterdata. If set to **reuse** will try to reuse running workers if exist |


## Consume mode

In this mode, Lithops can start and stop an existing VM, and deploy an entire job to that VM. The partition logic in this scenario is different from the `create/reuse` modes, since the entire job is executed in the same VM.

### AWS Credential setup

Lithops loads AWS credentials as specified in the [boto3 configuration guide](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html).

In summary, you can use one of the following settings:

1. Provide the credentials via the `~/.aws/config` file, or set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

    You can run `aws configure` command if the AWS CLI is installed to setup the credentials. Then set in the Lithops config file:
    ```yaml
    lithops:
        backend: aws_ec2

    aws_ec2:
        region : <REGION_NAME>
        exec_mode: consume
        instance_id : <INSTANCE ID OF THE VM>
    ```

2. Provide the credentials in the `aws` section of the Lithops config file:
    ```yaml
    lithops:
        backend: aws_ec2

    aws:
        access_key_id: <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
        secret_access_key: <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
        region: <REGION_NAME>

    aws_ec2:
        exec_mode: consume
        instance_id : <INSTANCE ID OF THE VM>
    ```

## Test Lithops
Once you have your compute and storage backends configured, you can run a hello world function with:

```bash
lithops hello -b aws_ec2 -s aws_s3
```

## Viewing the execution logs

You can view the function executions logs in your local machine using the *lithops client*:

```bash
lithops logs poll
```

## VM Management

Lithops for AWS EC2 follows a Mater-Worker architecture (1:N).

All the VMs, including the master VM, are automatically stopped after a configurable timeout (see hard/soft dismantle timeouts).

You can login to the master VM and get a live ssh connection with:

```bash
lithops attach -b aws_ec2
```

The master and worker VMs contain the Lithops service logs in `/tmp/lithops-root/*-service.log`

To list all the available workers in the current moment, use the next command:

```bash
lithops worker list -b aws_ec2
```

You can also list all the submitted jobs with:

```bash
lithops job list -b aws_ec2
```

You can delete all the workers with:

```bash
lithops clean -b aws_ec2 -s aws_s3 
```

You can delete all the workers including the Master VM with the `--all` flag:

```bash
lithops clean -b aws_ec2 -s aws_s3 --all
```
