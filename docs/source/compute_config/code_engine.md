# IBM Cloud Code Engine

[IBM Code Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview) allows you to run your application, job or container on a managed serverless platform. Auto-scale workloads and only pay for the resources you consume.

IBM Code Engine exposes both Knative and Kubernetes Job Descriptor API. Lithops supports both of them. Follow IBM Code Engine documentation to get more details on the difference between those APIs.

##  Installation

Choose one option:

### Option 1 (IBM CLoud Dashboard):
1. Navigate to the [IBM Cloud Code Engine dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/landing) and create a new project in your preferred region.


### Option 2 (IBM CLoud CLI tool):
In this step you are required to install IBM Cloud CLI tool, Code Engine plugin and create new Code Engine project

1. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started):

   ```bash
   curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
   ```

2. Login to your account, pointing to the region you want to create a project

   ```bash
   ibmcloud login -r us-south
   ```

3. Install the IBM Code Engine plugin:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud plugin install code-engine
   ```

4. Create a new Code Engine project (you can also do this through the dashboard). If you already have an existing project, then proceed to step 5:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud ce project create --name myproject
   ```

5. Target to your project:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud ce project select --name myproject
   ```
  
## Configuration

Choose one option:

### Option 1 (IBM IAM):
1. If you don't have an IAM API key created, navigate to the [IBM IAM dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

2. Click `Create an IBM Cloud API Key` and provide the necessary information.

3. Copy the generated IAM API key (You can only see the key the first time you create it, so make sure to copy it).

4. Locate the kubernetes config file using the IBM CLoud CLI:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud ce project current
   ```

5. Print the content of the kubernetes config file and copy the `namespace` value under the context section.

6. Edit your lithops config and add the following keys:

    ```yaml
    lithops:
        backend: code_engine
        
    ibm:
        iam_api_key: <IAM_API_KEY>
       
    code_engine:
        namespace  : <NAMESPACE>
        region     : <REGION>
    ```

### Option 2 (KUBECONFIG file):

1. Locate the kubernetes config file using the IBM CLoud CLI:

   ```bash
   ibmcloud ce project current
   ```

2. Set or copy the KUBECONFIG environment variable as printed in the previous step:

   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG=<PATH TO YAML FILE>
   ```

3. Edit your lithops config and add the following keys:

    ```yaml
    lithops:
        backend: code_engine
       
    code_engine:
        kubecfg_path: <PATH TO CONFIG YAML FILE>
    ```

## Runtime

### Use a pre-built runtime
To work with Code Engine there is need to use dedicated runtime. You can use a pre-built runtime listed below

|Default runtime name| Python version | What is included | Lithops version |
|----|-----|----|-----|
|ibmfunctions/lithops-ce-v385:230 | 3.8 | [included](https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops/blob/master/runtime/code_engine/requirements.txt) | 2.3.0 |
|ibmfunctions/lithops-ce-v385:232 | 3.8 | [included](https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops/blob/master/runtime/code_engine/requirements.txt) | 2.3.2 |
|ibmfunctions/lithops-ce-v385:233 | 3.8 | [included](https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops/blob/master/runtime/code_engine/requirements.txt) | 2.3.3 |
|ibmfunctions/lithops-ce-v385:234 | 3.8 | [included](https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops/blob/master/runtime/code_engine/requirements.txt) | 2.3.4 |
|ibmfunctions/lithops-ce-v385:235 | 3.8 | [included](https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops/blob/master/runtime/code_engine/requirements.txt) | 2.3.5 |

### Use your own runtime
If a pre-built runtime is not provided, Lithops automatically builds the default runtime the first time you run a script. For this task it uses the **docker** command installed locally in your machine. To make this working, you need:

1. [Install the Docker CE version](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. Login to your docker account:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

### Custom runtime

If you need to create a runtime with custom system packages and libraries, please follow [Building and managing Lithops runtimes to run the functions](https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops/tree/master/runtime/code_engine)


## Configure a private container registry for your runtime

### Configure Docker hub
To configure Lithops to access a private repository in your docker hub account, you need to extend the Code Engine config and add the following keys:

```yaml
code_engine:
    ....
    docker_server  : docker.io
    docker_user      : <Docker hub username>
    docker_password  : <DOcker hub access TOEKN>
```

#### Configure IBM Container Registry
To configure Lithops to access to a private repository in your IBM Container Registry, you need to extend the Code Engine config and add the following keys:

```yaml
code_engine:
    ....
    docker_server    : us.icr.io  # Change-me if you have the CR in another region
    docker_user      : iamapikey
    docker_password  : <IBM IAM API KEY>
```

## Summary of configuration keys for Job API:

|Group|Key|Default|Mandatory|Additional info|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|code_engine | namespace |  |no | Namespace name|
|code_engine | region |  | no | Cluster region. One of *us-south*, *jp-tok*, *eu-de*, *eu-gb* |
|code_engine | kubecfg_path | |no | **Mandatory** if no namepsace and no region. Path to kubecfg file. Only set if config file not in `~/.kube/config` or KUBECONFIG env var not present|
|code_engine | docker_server | docker.io |no | Docker server URL |
|code_engine | docker_user | |no | Docker hub username |
|code_engine | docker_password | |no | Login to your docker hub account and generate a new access token [here](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)|
|code_engine | max_workers | 1000 | no | Max number of workers per `FunctionExecutor()`|
|code_engine | worker_processes | 1 | no | Number of Lithops processes within a given worker. This can be used to parallelize function activations within a worker. It is recommendable to set this value to the same number of CPUs of the container. |
|code_engine | runtime |  |no | Docker image name.|
|code_engine | runtime_cpu | 0.125 |no | CPU limit. Default 0.125vCPU. See [valid combinations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-mem-cpu-combo) |
|code_engine | runtime_memory | 256 |no | Memory limit in MB. Default 256Mi. See [valid combinations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-mem-cpu-combo) |
|code_engine | runtime_timeout | 600 |no | Runtime timeout in seconds. Default 600 seconds |
|code_engine | connection_retries | |no | If specified, number of job invoke retries in case of connection failure with error code 500 |


## Lithops using Knative API of Code Engine

The preferable way to run Lithops in Code Engine is by using the JOB API. However, Lithops can be also executed in Code Engine using the Knative API. To configure this mode of execution refer to the [Knative documentation](https://github.com/lithops-cloud/lithops/blob/master/config/compute/knative.md#configuration) and follow the steps to configure Knative.


### Usage Example

```python
import lithops

iterdata = ['Gil', 'Dana', 'John', 'Scott']

def add_value(name):
    return 'Hello ' + name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    lt = lithops.FunctionExecutor(backend='code_engine', runtime='ibmfunctions/lithops-ce-v385:235')
    lt.map(add_value, iterdata)
    print(lt.get_result())
```

###  Troubleshooting

#### Fault
Lithops throws exception with 'Missing access token parameter'

##### Cause / Remedy
This likely occurs when you were logout from ibmcloud or the kubectl token can't re-generate new authentication token. To resolve this login into ibmcloud and re-create kubectl file

    ibmcloud login -r <CE Project Region>
    ibmcloud target -g <GROUP> -o <ORG>
    ibmcloud ce project select --name <CPROJECT NAME> --kubecfg
