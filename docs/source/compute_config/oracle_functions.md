# Oracle Functions (beta)

Lithops with *Oracle Functions* as serverless compute backend.

**Note**: This is a beta backend. Please open an issue if you encounter any error/bug

## Installation

1. Install Oracle Cloud backend dependencies:
```
python3 -m pip install lithops[oracle]
```

2. Access to your [Oracle Cloud Console](https://cloud.oracle.com/) and activate your Functions service instance.

## Configuration


### Creating a Dynamic Group

1. **Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Console.** 

2. **Open the navigation menu.** Under Identity & Security , go to Polices and then click **Domains**.

3. On the left menu, select one compartment. Your account name is the dfault compartment.

4. Click on the current Domain (It's called **Default** by default) and then click on **Dynamic groups**. Click **Create Dynamic Group.**

5. In the **Create Dynamic Group** dialog box:

    - Give your dynamic group a **Name** (for example: lithops) and **Description**.
  
    - In the **Matching Rule** box, paste the next rule, where <compartment_id> is the OCID of the compartment where the application and associated functions will be deployed. You can obtain it from [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/compartments):

        ```
        ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = '<compartment_id>'}
        ```
    
6. **Click Create** to create the dynamic group.


### Creating a Policy for the Dynamic Group

Now that the dynamic group is set up, you'll need to create a policy that allows this group to manage resources.

1. **Open the navigation menu again.** Under Governance and Administration, go to Identity, and then click [**Policies**](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/domains/policies).

2. Choose your **compartment** and Click on the **Create Policy** button.

3. **In the Create Policy dialog box:**

    - Give your policy a **Name** (for example: lithops) and **Description**.
    
    - In the **Statement** box, input the policy statement that grants permissions. Replace `<group_name>` with the name of the dynamic group you just created:

        ```
        Allow dynamic-group <group_name> to manage all-resources in tenancy
        ```

5. **Click Create** to create the policy.


### Configure lithops
Now, your Oracle Functions have the necessary permissions to manage resources in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy.

1. Navigate to the [VCNs page](https://cloud.oracle.com/networking/vcns) and create a new VCN using the **VCN Wizard**. Then choose *create VCN with Internet Connectivity*. In the next page, you can uncheck `Use DNS hostnames in this VCN` and leave the rest of the parameters as provided by default.

2. The **VCN Wizard** will create all the necessary VCN resources, including the subnets. Now access the private subnet and copy the OCID to the `subnet_id` parameter under the `oracle_f` section of the configuration.

3. Navigate to the [API keys page](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/domains/my-profile/api-keys) and generate and download a new API signing keys. Omit this step if you already generated and downloaded one key. When you generate a new Key, oracle provides a sample config file with most of the required parameters by lithops. Copy all the `key:value` pairs and configure lithops as follows:


```yaml
lithops:
    backend: oracle_f

oracle:
    user: <USER>
    region: <REGION>
    fingerprint: <FINGERPRINT>
    tenancy: <TENANCY>
    key_file: <KEY_FILE>
    compartment_id: <COMPARTMENT_ID>

oracle_f:
    subnet_id: <SUBNET_OCID>
```


Also, remember to login into your Oracle container registry before you build your runtime. This is because runtimes are uploaded to the Oracle container registry. `<username>` is probably your email address. You can create a new auth token [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/domains/my-profile/auth-tokens)

```
docker login <region>.ocir.io -u <tenancy-namespace>/<username> -p <authentication_token>
```

## Summary of configuration keys for Oracle:

|Group|Key|Default|Mandatory|Additional info|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|oracle | user | |yes |  Oracle Cloud User's OCID from [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/domains/my-profile) |
|oracle | region | |yes | Region Identifier from [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/regions). For example: `eu-madrid-1` |
|oracle | fingerprint | |yes | Fingerprint of the private key PEM file from [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/domains/my-profile/api-keys)|
|oracle | tenancy | |yes | Tenancy's OCID from [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/tenancy)|
|oracle | key_file | |yes | Path to the private key (PEM) file |
|oracle | compartment_id | |yes | Compartment's ID from [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/compartments)|

## Summary of configuration keys for Oracle Functions :

|Group|Key|Default|Mandatory|Additional info|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|oracle_f | subnet_id |  |yes | Private subnet OCID |
|oracle_f | region | |no | Region name. For example: `eu-madrid-1`. Lithops will use the region set under the `oracle` section if it is not set here |
|oracle_f | max_workers | 300 | no | Max number of workers. Oracle limits to 60 GB RAM, any number of workers  |
|oracle_f | worker_processes | 1 | no | Number of Lithops processes within a given worker. This can be used to parallelize function activations within a worker |
|oracle_f | runtime |  |no | Runtime name you built and deployed using the lithops client|
|oracle_f | runtime_memory | 256 |no | Memory limit in MB. Default 256MB |

## Test Lithops
Once you have your compute and storage backends configured, you can run a hello world function with:

```bash
lithops hello -b oracle_f -s oracle_oss
```

## Viewing the execution logs

You can view the function executions logs in your local machine using the *lithops client*:

```bash
lithops logs poll
```
