# AWS Lambda

Lithops with *AWS Lambda* as serverless compute backend.

## Configuration

1. [Login](https://console.aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_m_mc) to Amazon Web Services Console (or signup if you don't have an account)
 
2. Navigate to **IAM > Policies**. Click on **Create policy**.

3. Select **JSON** tab and paste the following JSON policy:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "lambda:*",
                "ec2:*",
                "ecr:*",
                "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Click **Next: Tags** and **Next: Review**. Fill the policy name field (you can name it `lithops-policy` or simmilar) and create the policy.

5. Go back to **IAM** and navigate to **Roles** tab. Click **Create role**.

6. Choose **Lambda** on the use case list and click **Next: Permissions**. Select the policy created before (`lithops-policy`). Click **Next: Tags** and **Next: Review**. Type a role name, for example `lithops-execution-role`. Click on *Create Role*.

7. Edit your lithops config and add the following keys:

```yaml
lithops:
    backend: aws_lambda

aws:
    region: <REGION_NAME>
    access_key_id: <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    secret_access_key: <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

aws_lambda:
    execution_role: <EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN>
```

## Summary of configuration keys for AWS

### AWS

|Group|Key|Default|Mandatory|Additional info|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|aws | region | |yes | AWS Region. For example `us-east-1` |
|aws | access_key_id | |yes | Account access key to AWS services. To find them, navigate to *My Security Credentials* and click *Create Access Key* if you don't already have one. |
|aws | secret_access_key | |yes | Account secret access key to AWS services. To find them, navigate to *My Security Credentials* and click *Create Access Key* if you don't already have one. |
|aws | session_token | |no | Session token for temporary AWS credentials |
|aws | account_id | |no | *This field will be used if present to retrieve the account ID instead of using AWS STS. The account ID is used to format full image names for container runtimes. |

### AWS Lambda

| Group | Key | Default | Mandatory | Additional info |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| aws_lambda | execution_role |  | yes | ARN of the execution role created at step 3. You can find it in the Role page at the *Roles* list in the *IAM* section (e.g. `arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/lithops-execution-role` |
| aws_lambda | region |  | no | Region where Lambda functions will be invoked (e.g. `us-east-1`). Lithops will use the `region` set under the `aws` section if it is not set here |
| aws_lambda | max_workers | 1000 | no | Max number of workers per `FunctionExecutor()` |
| aws_lambda | worker_processes | 1 | no | Number of Lithops processes within a given worker. This can be used to parallelize function activations within a worker |
| aws_lambda | runtime |  | no | Docker image name |
| aws_lambda | runtime_memory | 256 | no | Memory limit in MB. Default 256MB |
| aws_lambda | runtime_timeout | 180 | no | Runtime timeout in seconds. Default 3 minutes |
| aws_lambda | invoke_pool_threads | 64 | no | Number of concurrent threads used for invocation |
| aws_lambda | remote_invoker | False | no | Activate the remote invoker feature that uses one cloud function to spawn all the actual `map()` activations |
| aws_lambda | architecture | x86_64 | no | Runtime architecture. One of **x86_64** or **arm64** |
| aws_lambda | ephemeral_storage | 512 | no | Ephemeral storage (`/tmp`) size in MB (must be between 512 MB and 10240 MB) |
| aws_lambda | env_vars | {} | no | List of {name: ..., value: ...} pairs for Lambda instance environment variables |
| aws_lambda | namespace |  | no | Virtual namesapce. This can be usefull to virtually group Lithops function workers. The functions deployed by lithops will be prefixed by this namespace. For example you can set it to differentiate between `prod`, `dev` and `stage` environments.  |

## Additional configuration

### VPC
To connect the Lithops lambda to a VPC, add the following configuration to the `aws_lambda` configuration section:

```yaml
aws_lambda:
    execution_role: <EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN>
    region: <REGION_NAME>
    vpc:
        subnets:
            - <SUBNET_ID_1>
            - <SUBNET_ID_2>
            ...
        security_groups:
            - <SECURITY_GROUP_1>
            - <SECURITY_GROUP_2>
                ...
```

- `subnets`: A list of VPC subnet IDs.
- `security_groups`: A list of VPC security groups IDs.

**Note:** To be able to create network interfaces for Lambda functions, the role created in step 3 has to have permissions to do so, for example by adding the permission *EC2FullAccess*.

For more information, check out [AWS documentation on VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html).

### EFS
To attach EFS volumes to the Lithops lambda, add the following configuration to the `aws_lambda` configuration section:

```yaml
aws_lambda:
    execution_role: <EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN>
    region: <REGION_NAME>
    vpc:
        ...
    efs:
        - access_point: <EFS_ACCESS_POINT_1>
          mount_path: <LAMBDA_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH_1>
        - access_point: <EFS_ACCESS_POINT_2>
          mount_path: <LAMBDA_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH_2>
            ...
```

- `access_point`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EFS access point that provides access to the file system.
- `mount_path`: The path where the function can access the file system. It **must** start with `/mnt`.

**Note:** to access those volumes, the Lithops lambda has to be connected to the same VPC and subnets as the EFS volumes are mounted to.

For more information, check out [AWS documentation on attaching EFS volumes to Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-amazon-efs-for-aws-lambda-in-your-serverless-applications/).


## Test Lithops
Once you have your compute and storage backends configured, you can run a hello world function with:

```bash
lithops hello -b aws_lambda -s aws_s3
```

## Viewing the execution logs

You can view the function executions logs in your local machine using the *lithops client*:

```bash
lithops logs poll
```
