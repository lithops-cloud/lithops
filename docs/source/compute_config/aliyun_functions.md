# Aliyun Function Compute

Lithops with *Aliyun Function Compute* as serverless compute backend.

## Installation

1. Install Alibaba Cloud backend dependencies:

```
python3 -m pip install lithops[aliyun]
```

2. Access to your [console](https://homenew-intl.console.aliyun.com/) and activate your Functions service instance.

## Configuration

1. [Navigate to the Cloud Console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/manage/ak) and create a new AccessKey (If you don't have one)

2. [Access to your Function Compute dashboard](https://fc.console.aliyun.com/fc/overview), and choose your preferred region.

3. Access to the [Resource Access Management (RAM) Roles dashboard](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/roles/), and create a new Role that contains the `AliyunOSSFullAccess` permission. Alternatively you can use an already created Role that contains the `AliyunOSSFullAccess` permission.

4. Edit your Lithops config and add the following keys:

```yaml
lithops:
    backend : aliyun_fc

aliyun:
    account_id: <ACCOUNT_ID>
    access_key_id: <ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    access_key_secret: <ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>
    region : <REGION_NAME>

aliyun_fc:
    role_arn: <ROLE_ARN>
```

4. **(optional)** By default Lithops will automatically create a new **service** in your *Function Compute* account. For this purpose your user must have **List** and **Create** permissions to *Function Compute*. Alternatively, you can create a new service through the dashboard (or use one already created), assign the Role created in the previous step (Accessing to *service configuration* --> *Modify Configuration* --> *Role Config*), and configure the *service* entry in the *aliyun_cf* config section.

## Test Lithops
Once you have your compute and storage backends configured, you can run a hello world function with:

```bash
lithops hello -b aliyun_fc -s aliyun_oss
```


## Viewing the execution logs

You can view the function executions logs in your local machine using the *lithops client*:

```bash
lithops logs poll
```
