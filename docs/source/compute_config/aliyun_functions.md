# Aliyun Function Compute

Lithops with *Aliyun Function Compute* as serverless compute backend.

## Installation

1. Install Alibaba Cloud backend dependencies:

```
$ python3 -m pip install lithops[aliyun]
```

1. Access to your [console](https://homenew-intl.console.aliyun.com/) and activate your Functions service instance.

## Configuration

1. [Access to your Function Compute dashboard](https://fc.console.aliyun.com/fc/overview), choose your preferred region, and copy the public endpoint.

2. Access to the [Resource Access Management (RAM) Roles dashboard](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/roles/), and create a new Role that contains the `AliyunOSSFullAccess` permission. Alternatively you can use an already created Role that contains the `AliyunOSSFullAccess` permission.


3. Edit your Lithops config and add the following keys:

```yaml
  lithops:
      backend : aliyun_fc

  aliyun:
    access_key_id: <ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    access_key_secret: <ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>

  aliyun_fc:
      public_endpoint : <PUBLIC_ENDPOINT>
      role_arn: <ROLE_ARN>
```

4. **(optional)** By default Lithops will automatically create a new **service** in your *Function Compute* account. For this purpose your user must have **List** and **Create** permissions to *Function Compute*. Alternatively, you can create a new service through the dashboard (or use one already created), assign the Role created in the previous step (Accessing to *service configuration* --> *Modify Configuration* --> *Role Config*), and configure the *service* entry in the *aliyun_cf* config section.
