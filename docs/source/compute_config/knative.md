# Knative

Lithops with *Knative* as serverless compute backend. Lithops also supports vanilla Knative for running applications. The easiest way to make it working is to create an IBM Kubernetes (IKS) cluster through the [IBM dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/landing). Alternatively you can use your own kubernetes cluster or a kind/minikube installation.

## Installation

Note that Lithops automatically builds the default runtime the first time you run a script. For this task it uses the **docker** command installed locally in your machine.

1. [Install the Docker CE version](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. Login to your docker account:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

3. Choose one of these 3 installation options:

### Option 1 - Minikube:

4. Start minikube with the 'ingress' addon:
   ```bash
   minikube start --addons=ingress
   ```

5. [Follow this instructions to install knative serving.](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/)

6. Install a networking layer. Currently Lithops supports **Kourier**. [Follow these instructions to install Kourier.](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/#install-a-networking-layer)

7. Edit your lithops config and add:
    ```yaml
    knative:
        ingress_endpoint : http://127.0.0.1:80
    ```

8. On a separate terminal, keep running:
   ```bash
   minikube tunnel
   ```

### Option 2 - IBM IKS:

4. Access to the [IBM dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/landing) and create a new Kubernetes cluster.

5. Once the cluster is running, follow the instructions of the "Actions"--> "Connect via CLI" option of the dashboard to configure the *kubectl* client in your local machine. 

6. [Follow this instructions to install knative serving.](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/)

7. Install a networking layer. Currently Lithops supports **Kourier**. [Follow these instructions to install Kourier.](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/#install-a-networking-layer)


### Option 3 - IBM IKS or any other Kubernetes Cluster:

4. Install Kubernetes >= v1.16 and make sure the *kubectl* client is running.

6. [Follow this instructions to install knative serving.](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/)

7. Install a networking layer. Currently Lithops supports **Kourier**. [Follow these instructions to install Kourier.](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/#install-a-networking-layer)


## Configuration

8. Make sure you have the ~/.kube/config file. Alternatively, you can set KUBECONFIG environment variable:
   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-kube-config-file>
   ```

9. Edit your lithops config and add the following keys:
    ```yaml
    lithops:
        backend: knative
    ```

### Configure a private container registry for your runtime

#### Configure Docker hub
To configure Lithops to access a private repository in your docker hub account, you need to extend the Knative config and add the following keys:

```yaml
knative:
    ....
    docker_server    : docker.io
    docker_user      : <Docker hub Username>
    docker_password  : <DOcker hub access TOEKN>
```

#### Configure IBM Container Registry
To configure Lithops to access to a private repository in your IBM Container Registry, you need to extend the Knative config and add the following keys:

```yaml
knative:
    ....
    docker_server    : us.icr.io
    docker_user      : iamapikey
    docker_password  : <IBM IAM API KEY>
    docker_namespace : <namespace>  # namespace name from https://cloud.ibm.com/registry/namespaces
```

## Summary of configuration keys for Knative:

|Group|Key|Default|Mandatory|Additional info|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|knative | kubecfg_path | |no | Path to kubecfg file. Mandatory if config file not in `~/.kube/config` or KUBECONFIG env var not present|
|knative | networking_layer | kourier |no | One of: **kourier** or **istio**  |
|knative | ingress_endpoint | |no | Ingress endpoint. Make sure to use http:// prefix |
|knative | docker_server | docker.io |no | Container registry URL |
|knative | docker_user | |no | Container registry user name |
|knative | docker_password | |no | Container registry password/token. In case of Docker hub, login to your docker hub account and generate a new access token [here](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)|
|knative | git_url | |no | Git repository to build the image |
|knative | git_rev | |no | Git revision to build the image |
|knative | max_workers | 100 | no | Max number of workers per `FunctionExecutor()`|
|knative | worker_processes | 1 | no | Number of Lithops processes within a given worker. This can be used to parallelize function activations within a worker. It is recommendable to set this value to the same number of CPUs of the container. |
|knative | runtime |  |no | Docker image name|
|knative | runtime_cpu | 1 |no | CPU limit. Default 1vCPU |
|knative | runtime_memory | 512 |no | Memory limit in MB. Default 512 |
|knative | runtime_timeout | 600 |no | Runtime timeout in seconds. Default 600 seconds |
|knative | invoke_pool_threads | 100 |no | Number of concurrent threads used for invocation |

### Verify

10. Verify that all the pods from the following namespaces are in *Running* status: 
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n knative-serving
    ```

11. Monitor how pods and other resources are created:
    ```bash
    watch kubectl get pod,service,revision,deployment -o wide
    ```

## Test Lithops

Once you have your compute and storage backends configured, you can run a hello world function with:

```bash
lithops hello -b knative -s ibm_cos
```

## Viewing the execution logs

You can view the function executions logs in your local machine using the *lithops client*:

```bash
lithops logs poll
```
