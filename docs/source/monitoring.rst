Monitoring
==========

By default, Lithops uses the storage backend to monitor function activations: Each function activation stores a file
named *{id}/status.json* to the Object Storage when it finishes its execution. This file contains some statistics about
the execution, including if the function activation ran successfully or not. Having these files, the default monitoring
approach is based on listing the Object Store objects (polling) each X seconds to know which function activations have
finished and which not.

As this default approach can slow-down the total application execution time, due to the number of requests it has to
make against the object store, in Lithops we integrated a RabbitMQ service to monitor function activations in real-time.
With RabbitMQ, the content of the *{id}/status.json* file is sent trough a queue. This speeds-up total application execution
time, since Lithops only needs one connection to the messaging service to monitor all function activations. We currently
support the AMQP protocol.

.. note:: The RabbitMQ server has to be accessible from both the client and the functions. For example, it could be deployed in a cloud server with a public IP address and with the AMQP port open (5672).

To enable Lithops to use this service, add the *AMQP_URL* key into the *rabbitmq* section in
the configuration, for example:

.. code:: yaml

    rabbitmq:
        amqp_url: <AMQP_URL>  # amqp://

In addition, activate the monitoring service by setting ``monitoring: rabbitmq`` in the configuration (Lithops section):

.. code:: yaml

    lithops:
       monitoring: rabbitmq


.. code:: python

    fexec = lithops.FunctionExecutor(monitoring='rabbitmq')
