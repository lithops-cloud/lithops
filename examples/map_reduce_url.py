"""
Simple Lithops example using the map_reduce method which
counts the number of words inside each object specified
in 'iterdata' variable.

This example processes some objects which are in public URLs.

As in this case you are processing objects from COS, the
map_reduce() method will first launch a partitioner to split
the objects in smaller chunks, thus increasing the parallelism
of the execution and reducing the total time needed to process
the data. After creating the partitions, it will launch one
map function for each partition, and one reducer for all
partitions of the same object. In this case you will get
one result for each object specified in 'iterdata' variable.

In the reduce function there will be always one parameter
from where you can access to the partial results.
