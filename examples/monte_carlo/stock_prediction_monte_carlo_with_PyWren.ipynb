    "# <span style=\"color:blue\">Stock prediction with Monte Carlo methods</span>\n",
    "We demonstrate how to run Monte Carlo simuluations with [PyWren-IBM-Cloud](https://github.com/pywren/pywren-ibm-cloud) over IBM Cloud Functions. This notebook contains an example of stock prediction with Monte Carlo. The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how IBM Cloud Functions can benefit Monte Carlo simulations and not how stock prediction works. As stock prediction is very complicated and requires many prior knowledge and correct models, we did not innovate the Monte Carlo Method for handling the unpredictability of stock prices, nor do we provide any results for prediction based on long term data sources.\n",
